# DiscordWojackBot
Code repository for my personal discord meme bot project

This bot uses a config.json file, demonstrated as example.json. 
"admin" should be your unique discord user ID. "token" should be 
the API token for your Discord application.

He might be a raging dumpster fire, but he's my raging dumpster fire, 
and I'm proud of him, dammit.

**TODO**: 
* Migrate local db content to AWS S3 and DynamoDB
* Add bot admin configuration and commands, i.e. add admin users, mute bot in channels, set cooldown timers, etc.
* Refactor modules to more cleanly separate db/function code.
